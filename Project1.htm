<h1> Web Site Critiques <h1>
<h2> Utah National Parks - http://www.utah.com/nationalparks/ <h2>

<hr>
<ol> 1. The website is pretty organized in my opinion. But it does still feel a bit unorganized/crazy as well because it is presenting a lot of information with a lot of different links to other pages as well.</ol>
<ol> 2. Yes the links are on the right and the text is on the right.They also have tabs on the top to help as well. </ol>
<ol> 3. It does not confuse me. At first I was a bit overwhelmed but once I navigated around it started to make more sense. </ol>
<ol> 4. I think it enhances because of all the pictures that are super cool and pretty. If it were not for the pictures though maybe just because all the links and tabs but the pictures saved it for me at least. </ol>
<ol> 5. It did not take very long. It did take a few seconds but it could have been my wifi being slow as well. </ol>
<ol> 6. I think the text color and size were okay. I liked the use of a background picture but not for everything. It is nice every once and a while. But can also over do it if used to much. </ol>
<ol> 7. It has a navigation bar and a search bar as well. Super handy and well navigated in my opinion. </ol>
<ol> 8. I feel like it was pretty basic and not much color besides the links and bolded text. I liked it. Kept it simple and not over the top trying to add a ton of color. </ol>
<ol> 9. It is a bit harder to read and navigate but nothing like anyother site. Smaller window sizes are just a struggle no matter what in my opinion. </ol>
<ol> 10. It almost makes you feel like you are there with all the color pictures which I thought was super cool. I always think it is super impressive when websites can make you feel like you are in the place you are looking/reading about. Very well done! </ol>
